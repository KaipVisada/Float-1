                English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, alchemist, theologian and one of the most influential
                men in human history. His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is considered to be the most
                influential book in the history of science.

                        his theory of relativity and specifically mass–energy equivalence, expressed by the equation E = mc2. Einstein received
                        the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics “for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of
                        the photoelectric effect.

                        and be quite insane.”<br><br> Tesla was a Serbian engineer and inventor who is often described as the most important scientist
                        and inventor of the modern age, a man who “shed light over the face of Earth”. He is best known for many revolutionary
                        contributions in the field of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
